Our custom implementation of a random forest regressor has been implemented in the files DT_regressor.py and random_forest_regressor.py

We used the Real Estate Valuation data set, found under https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set
and the Colleges data set, found under https://openml.org/search?type=data&sort=version&status=any&order=asc&exact_name=colleges&id=42727.
The downloaded .csv files and their preprocessed versions are included.

The code generated by the LMM (TODO: model name) can be found in llm.py the prompt used in prompt.txt.

The files that actually train various regression models and compare them are ??? and ???.
