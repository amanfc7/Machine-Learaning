Our custom implementation of a random forest regressor has been implemented in the files DT_regressor.py and random_forest_regressor.py

We used the Real Estate Valuation data set, found under https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set
and the Colleges data set, found under https://openml.org/search?type=data&sort=version&status=any&order=asc&exact_name=colleges&id=42727.
The downloaded .csv files and their preprocessed versions are included.

The code generated by the LMM (ChatGTP) can be found in LLM_real_estate_valuation.py and LLM_colleges.py, the prompt used in LLM_prompt.txt.

The files that actually train various regression models and compare them are data_set_1_regr.py and data_set_1_regr.py for Colleges and Real Estate Valuation, respectively.
